The required dependencies, including React, Firebase, and the React hooks useAuthState and useCollectionData, are imported by the code. 

The App component, which houses the chat room's primary layout, is then set up. 

Using the useAuthState hook, it determines if the user is logged in and, depending on the authentication state, 
either the ChatRoom or SignIn components are displayed. 

The SignIn component renders a button that allows users to sign in with their Google account 
using the signInWithGoogle function. 

The SignOut component renders a button that allows users to sign out if they are already signed in. 

The primary conversation interface is rendered by the ChatRoom component. 

In order to scroll to the bottom of the conversation when a new message is submitted, it creates a reference to 
the fake element using the useRef hook. 

The useCollectionData hook is then used to obtain the messages from the Fire store database, and the ChatMessage component is used to render 
each message. 

When a user presses the send button, a new message is added to the Firestore database using the sendMessage function. 

It uses the add function to add the message to the Firestore database after first retrieving the current user's uid and photoURL. 

Additionally, it uses the dummy.current.scrollIntoView method to scroll to the bottom of the chat and resets the formValue state.  

Every message in the chat is rendered using the ChatMessage component. 

It applies the proper styling and determines if the message was delivered or received using the messageClass variable.
